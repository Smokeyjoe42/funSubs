1
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:06,702
It's nightfall.

2
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,446
The job of a vampire's familiar

3
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:13,448
is not an easy one.

4
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,884
It's very dangerous.

5
00:00:14,927 --> 00:00:17,147
I mean, they are vampires,
after all.

6
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:19,497
We can go in now.

7
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:27,288
Good evening, Master.

8
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:29,203
MAN :
Guillermo?

9
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:30,639
Yes, sir?

10
00:00:30,682 --> 00:00:32,728
-Is that you?
-Yes, Master.

11
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,556
-Okay.
-Okay, Master.

12
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:37,124
It's time to... rise.

13
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:39,213
MAN:
The... Okay.

14
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:45,132
MAN:
Guillermo, it is stuck.

15
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:46,698
I think it is the latch.

16
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:48,309
GUILLERMO:
Being a vampire's familiar

17
00:00:48,352 --> 00:00:50,746
is like being a best friend.

18
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,096
Who-Who's also a slave.

19
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,098
-MAN: Guillermo, it's too loud.-What?

20
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,447
GUILLERMO:
Tomorrow night marks

21
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,754
the ten-year anniversary since

22
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:00,103
I started working
for my Master.

23
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:03,933
I think he's planning
something pretty special.

24
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:07,023
: I think he's gonna
make me a vampire.

25
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:10,287
MAN:
This is very embarrassing.

26
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:12,681
Okay, Master.

27
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:14,683
He awakens.

28
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,478
Very cool, Master.

29
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:28,697
Very scary.

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,915
Thank you.

NANDOR:
Everyone?

40
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:11,392
Nadja, Laszlo.

41
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:13,307
-Yeah?
-Yes?
-Can you come downstairs

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,178
for a second, please?

43
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:17,441
Thank you, Laszlo.

44
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:19,530
In your own time, Nadja.

45
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:21,097
Yes, good, excellent.

46
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,229
So, listen.

47
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,405
We have received a letter

48
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:27,234
and I would like very much
to read it to you.

49
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:30,324
-But not here, we want to go
into the library.
-Why not here?

50
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,326
I'd like to read it in there.
It's just a formality.

51
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:33,414
It'll sound
exactly the same if you

52
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:35,242
read it here than if
you read it in there.

53
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:37,287
I'm not going to disagree with
you, but that's not the point.

54
00:02:37,331 --> 00:02:38,375
NANDOR:  I was a very ferocious soldier

55
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:40,116
in the Ottoman Empire.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,989
Which meant a lot of killing,
lot of pillaging.

57
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,689
People would say,
"Please, don't pillage me."

58
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:49,430
And I would say, "No.

59
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:53,216
I'm pillaging everyone,
you included."

60
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,131
I was relentless.

61
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,220
They would call me Nandor

62
00:02:57,264 --> 00:02:59,875
the Relentless.

63
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:02,660
Because I just never relent.

64
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:03,922
So I'd like very much for us
to go into there, please.

65
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:05,228
Just a formality.

66
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,143
Come on, please,
it's just a formality.

67
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,666
-You could have read it by now.-Hmm.

68
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,277
Just a formality, okay?
Look, it's not even that far.

69
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,887
-Oh, fuck this, fine.
-Thank you, Laszlo.

70
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,367
It's just a formality,
please, Nadja.

71
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,283
-Just a formality, thank you.

72
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:18,459
Guillermo, the door.

73
00:03:18,502 --> 00:03:20,243
-That wasn't so bad, was it?

74
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:24,465
Now before we go into
the reading of the letter,

75
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:27,337
I wanted to talk about
general hygiene in the cell.

76
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:28,730
-Last night,

77
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:30,601
there were all these people
down there,

78
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:33,300
shouting and screaming,
half-drunk.

79
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:35,258
Where did they find the alcohol?

80
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:38,174
No, they were half-drunk.
They'd been half drunk.

81
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,176
-Oh.
-Please, finish a whole victim

82
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,396
before moving on
to a next one, okay?

83
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,267
It's very unhygienic.

84
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,269
I think I know who's leaving
them down there,

85
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,271
-but I don't want to say.-If you've got something to say,

86
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:50,926
-then damn well say it.
-It's not hygienic.

87
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:52,841
How dare you.

88
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,327
The problems with living
with other vampires

89
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,111
are the vampires
I have chosen to stay with.

90
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,288
Nandor is like

91
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:07,551
a big turkey
just walking around

92
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,466
trying to control everything
on the farm.

93
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,076
-Hyah!

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,122
NADJA:
And Laszlo is my big, crazy,

95
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:15,646
wild bear and we love to chase
each other around the house.

96
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,996
-I ought to fucking kill you!

97
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,782
We have a great time together.

98
00:04:22,436 --> 00:04:24,351
LASZLO:
I was the most handsome man

99
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:25,308
in our village.

100
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,223
His village
was very badly affected

101
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,312
by leprosy and the plague.

102
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,531
That's true.

103
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:33,316
And I, myself,
did contract leprosy,

104
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,536
but I was quite lucky
'cause it couldn't be seen.

105
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,494
It was only one part
of my anatomy.

106
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:39,148
Well, I can see it.

107
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:41,411
Anyway, one night,

108
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,805
I was awoken by this...

109
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,460
horrible clawing at the window.

110
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,026
And I thought,
"Who the hell is that?

111
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,811
'Cause I live
on the third floor."

112
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:53,162
So I went to investigate it,
I threw back the curtain...

113
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:56,731
Well, I saw the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen.

114
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,342
But she was gripping the window

115
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:01,344
and she was clawing
at the glass.

116
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:02,693
I was hypnotized.

117
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:04,565
I used hypnosis on him.

118
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,349
Which I found out later.

119
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,569
Anyway,
obviously I invited her in.

120
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:10,527
We were about to make love

121
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,487
when she turned into this
hideous, leathery bat thing.

122
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,359
She drained me of my blood,

123
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,970
giving me the curse
of eternal life

124
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,059
and thus making me
a bloodthirsty

125
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:22,452
creature of the night.

126
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,722
Why don't we just
write on them with marker pen?

127
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,594
Put our names and the date?

128
00:05:33,637 --> 00:05:34,595
LASZLO:
Oh, that's a good suggestion.

129
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,031
-NADJA: Yeah.
-Good idea, Nadja.

130
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:37,641
Marker pens, Guillermo.

131
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,295
Make sure they're permanent.

132
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,557
-Sharpie.
-LASZLO: Genius.

133
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:43,865
-NADJA: With date, as well.
-Yes, great thinking, Nadja.

134
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,215
-And yes, this... yes.
-The name of the month,
day, year.

135
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:48,391
Okay.

136
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:50,654
And now we come...

137
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,439
to the reading... of the letter.

138
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:54,441
-At last.

139
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,790
Guillermo? Close the door.

140
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:58,923
-The door's closed, Master.
-Close it more.

141
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,058
More.

142
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:04,451
Good.

143
00:06:04,494 --> 00:06:06,409
-Now that we are
gathered here...

144
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:08,411
together as one, finally,

145
00:06:08,455 --> 00:06:09,978
in accordance with
the protocols...

146
00:06:10,021 --> 00:06:11,283
Which you made up.

147
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:13,329
Yes.

148
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,810
We have received this letter.

149
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:19,379
From Baron... Afanas.

150
00:06:23,687 --> 00:06:24,601
Really?

151
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:27,299
Yes.

152
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:28,649
NANDOR:
How do you...

153
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,086
-GUILLERMO: Like that.
-Shh.

154
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:32,566
The Baron...

155
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,874
...is coming to visit us.

156
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,702
Holy shit.

157
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:39,921
Silence, Guillermo.

158
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,444
Vampire comments only.

159
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:43,011
The Baron never leaves
the old country.

160
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:45,622
Has he told us what the purposeof his visit is?

161
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:49,017
Uh...

162
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,671
No.

163
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:52,281
LASZLO:
The Baron is a firm believer

164
00:06:52,324 --> 00:06:54,283
that vampires should rule
the world.

165
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,894
I think the main purpose
for the Baron's visit

166
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:59,288
is to find out whether
we as vampires

167
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,594
have populated America.

168
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,726
But as you can see,

169
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,728
the place is fucking massive.

170
00:07:04,772 --> 00:07:06,600
When is he coming, exactly?

171
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,558
-Tomorrow.
-Shit.

172
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,733
NANDOR:
Why didn't you give this
to me earlier?

173
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,474
It arrived this morning, Master.

174
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:13,955
NADJA:
Baron Afanas is...

175
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:17,741
a very charming member
of the vampire royalty.

176
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:19,351
A few hundred years ago,

177
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:22,354
we enjoyed a very intense,
very long sexual affair.

178
00:07:22,398 --> 00:07:23,486
It was pretty wild.

179
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,575
Lots of acrobatic stuff.

180
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:26,924
This could make it awkward,

181
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:29,884
to see him with Laszlo...

182
00:07:29,927 --> 00:07:31,712
present.

183
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:33,757
LASZLO:
Just between you and I,

184
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,759
a while back, the Baron and I

185
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,414
enjoyed a very intense
sex affair.

186
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,634
Very animalistic.

187
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,287
Acrobatic stuff, you might say.

188
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:43,550
So I, personally,

189
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:46,988
am very much looking forward
to reconnecting.

190
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,381
We should get a chariot led by

191
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,906
12 black alligators.

192
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:53,864
-I like that.
-That's a lot of alligators,

193
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:54,952
a lot of paint.

194
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,563
What about a van?

195
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,652
A van?

196
00:07:58,695 --> 00:07:59,566
That's not the same, is it?

197
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:01,306
Can you at least make sure
it's black?

198
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,353
Yeah. Black van for tomorrow?

199
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:07,661
Excellent. Uh, what about
the Baron's bloodlust?

200
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,532
-Virgins.
-Oh, yes, let's do that.

201
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,534
Guillermo, two virgins
by tomorrow evening.

202
00:08:11,578 --> 00:08:13,580
-Yes, when the Baron arrives

203
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:15,582
we shall feast on virgin blood.

204
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:25,243
Vampire only laughing.

205
00:08:25,287 --> 00:08:26,767
-Should we tell Colin Robinson?-Laszlo,

206
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,682
-that is a terrible idea.

207
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,684
He'll ruin the evening.

208
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,946
Uh, what would ruin the evening?

209
00:08:31,989 --> 00:08:34,557
I told you-- didn't close
the door properly.

210
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:37,865
Are we having a house meeting?

211
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,956
-No.
-No.

212
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,393
So, your gathering here...

213
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:46,569
is just a coincidence?

214
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,440
Yes.

215
00:08:49,877 --> 00:08:51,661
COLIN:
My name is Colin Robinson.

216
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,663
And I am what's known as

217
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,578
a psychic vampire.

218
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:57,362
Or energy vampire.

219
00:08:57,406 --> 00:08:59,016
This is my office.

220
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,453
Also known
as the hunting ground.

221
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:03,499
Hi, Deb.

222
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,023
Energy vampires drain
people's energy

223
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,634
merely by talking to them.

224
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:10,724
Actual v. Budget,
year-to-date, no thanks.

225
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:11,942
You're gonna be at that all day.

226
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,944
We either bore you

227
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:15,946
with a long conversation...

228
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,514
Feeling better now, I was
a little sick this weekend.

229
00:09:20,298 --> 00:09:21,952
Hey, Don.

230
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,388
Don?

231
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:24,999
I have to pee, too.

232
00:09:25,042 --> 00:09:26,261
Or...

233
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,305
Hey.

234
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,306
...we enrage you.

235
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:33,616
In fact, you probably know
an energy vampire.

236
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,487
We're the most common kind...

237
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,272
of vampire.

238
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,450
We are day-walkers,
not affected by the sun.

239
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:46,673
And we are
the only kind of vampire

240
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:49,676
that can drain
another vampire's energy.

241
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,461
It's very cool.

242
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:57,858
The power grows stronger
in him by the night.

243
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,693
GUILLERMO: There's different kinds of jobs that I have to do.

244
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,913
Keep the house tidy.

245
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:11,132
Make sure there's no sunlight.

246
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:16,267
Sunlight! Why, Guillermo,

247
00:10:16,311 --> 00:10:20,097
why?!

248
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,666
Not on my watch.

249
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,668
Getting rid of carcasses,

250
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:27,757
I feel, is a big one.

251
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,330
So, we are under the stairs
and this is my bedroom.

252
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:39,595
This is a picture of me
as Armand

253
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,553
from Interview with the Vampire.

254
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,555
Played by Antonio Banderas.

255
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:45,949
That was the first time
I've ever seen

256
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:47,821
an Hispanic vampire

257
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:51,128
in mainstream, like, movies.

258
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:54,088
And I said,
"If he can do it, I-I...

259
00:10:54,131 --> 00:10:55,698
I can do it."

260
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,831
Guillermo... boarded
this whole window up,

261
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,702
it's a huge sunlight risk.

262
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,312
We wouldn't want the Baron
waking up to sunlight

263
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:03,314
and being turned into
barbecue meat.

264
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:05,316
Yeah, really cover it.

265
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,927
He's made a lot of comments
recently, like,

266
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,364
"I'm going to make you
a vampire."

267
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:12,193
This is a little coffin toy
that, uh...

268
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:14,848
I hope to be
in one of these one day.

269
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,893
What ho, good friends.

270
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:18,590
LARPERS:
What ho!

271
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:21,898
There's still a few places
to find virgins.

272
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,858
LARPing stands for
Live Action Role Playing.

273
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,599
In regular life,
I'm just Jonathan.

274
00:11:27,643 --> 00:11:30,951
But here, I am
a very high-level paladin.

275
00:11:30,994 --> 00:11:31,995
GUILLERMO:
I'm not a killer.

276
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,998
I find people who are easy...

277
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,522
to... kill.

278
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,002
Is that a 14th-century
battle-ax?

279
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,787
Oh, it's so exciting.

280
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,658
Uh, will we be able
to touch the swords?

281
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,792
Oh, you'll touch the swords.

282
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:49,926
NADJA:
We moved here from Europe

283
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:52,320
about 200 years ago
because there was

284
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:55,889
a lot of prejudice  against vampires at that time.

285
00:12:00,632 --> 00:12:02,243
They don't like
the color of our skin.

286
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,767
Or the fact that
we killed and ate people.

287
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:07,770
Probably more that.

288
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:10,817
LASZLO:
We're being very careful
not to stand out,

289
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,819
which is why
we're both dressed down.

290
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:15,822
-Uh, good evening.
-Go back to your own country.

291
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,780
What the fuck did you just say?

292
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,608
You heard me,
Ghost of Christmas Past bitch.

293
00:12:19,651 --> 00:12:20,957
Oh, Mike, shut up.

294
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,873
Silence to you.
We've been here since 1861.

295
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:27,181
At least, our families have.

296
00:12:27,224 --> 00:12:28,965
Begone.

297
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,272
We should just suck their blood,I'm absolutely starving.

298
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:32,882
-They're perfect.
-No, I'm furious.

299
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:34,492
He just insulted me,
I'm in fifth gear.

300
00:12:34,536 --> 00:12:36,494
-We should kill them.
-Yes, that's what I'm saying.

301
00:12:36,538 --> 00:12:38,888
-We should suck their blood.
-Yes.

302
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:41,804
-LASZLO: Now?
-NADJA: Wait. Wait, darling.

303
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:44,459
-Now?
-Now!

304
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,678
What?

305
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,506
-Mike?

306
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,943
Where the fuck are you?

307
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:52,684
What the fuck?

308
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,734
Yum, yum, yum. He was delicious.

309
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,605
Now, listen,
I don't know about you,

310
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,086
but I'm very much in the mood
for some sexual intercourse.

311
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,308
Darling. Right next
to the public toilet?

312
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,310
Yes. But why don't I get home,

313
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,965
get cleaned up, then we can
carry on with our love-making.

314
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:14,228
Um, I'm going to walk home.

315
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:16,186
--Why the hell would you do that?

316
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,666
Why would you walk home?

317
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:19,668
When you could turn into a bat?

318
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,496
Bat!

319
00:13:26,936 --> 00:13:29,330
NANDOR:  I would like some of that, uh,

320
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:31,985
colorful dust that sparkles.

321
00:13:32,028 --> 00:13:34,248
-Glitter?
-Yes.

322
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,640
Get me some glitter.

323
00:13:35,684 --> 00:13:37,294
Whatever for, Master?

324
00:13:37,338 --> 00:13:39,122
Oh, I want to do
something special

325
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:40,907
for the Immortal One's arrival.

326
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:44,258
I'm going to sprinkle it
on my face and on my body.

327
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,347
Like Twilight.

328
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:51,134
So deliciously macabre.

329
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:54,094
-Creepy paper.
-It's crepe paper.

330
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:56,748
-Creepy paper.
-It's crepe paper, Master.

331
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,795
Creepy... Oh, multipack.

332
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,493
Master, this is
pretty "macarbre."

333
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:11,154
NANDOR:
Guillermo is my familiar,

334
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:13,591
but sometimes he's a little toofamiliar, you know what I mean?

335
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,245
I mean, he's always
just there.

336
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,030
I think it's good, Master.

337
00:14:17,073 --> 00:14:18,770
NANDOR:
I mean, he works really hard,

338
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:20,250
he's just not great at it.

339
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,165
Guillermo, my cape is stuck.

340
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,168
I don't like saying
this kind of thing

341
00:14:25,212 --> 00:14:26,909
in front of him, of course.

342
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,303
Sorry, Guillermo.

343
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:31,696
I don't like saying this kind
of thing in front of you.

344
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,829
That's okay, Master.

345
00:14:40,053 --> 00:14:41,184
Lot of glitter.

346
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:45,493
-Cash or card?
-Credit.

347
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,060
You cannot pay with that.

348
00:14:47,103 --> 00:14:48,800
GUILLERMO:
I'm so sorry.

349
00:14:48,844 --> 00:14:51,064
-Did you just throw a coin
at me?
-Yes.

350
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,109
Sir, you can't be throwing
ancient coins at me.

351
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:54,937
-Just... Credit card's fine.
-Guillermo, stab this man.

352
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,026
-He's joking.
-Stab him.

353
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,593
-Ahh...
-Thank you.

354
00:14:58,636 --> 00:15:00,508
-I tried, and...
-Here you go, man.

355
00:15:00,551 --> 00:15:02,727
-Thank you so much.
-You kind of disobeyed me
just now.

356
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:03,772
And I'm noting it.

357
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:12,085
NADJA:
Recently I have been
seeing another man.

358
00:15:15,088 --> 00:15:18,830
He doesn't see me, though,
because I sneak behind him.

359
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,316
I watch him in the night,

360
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,709
in secret.

361
00:15:42,245 --> 00:15:44,073
In the old country,
centuries ago,

362
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:46,336
I was in a very passionate
love affair

363
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,121
with a human man called Gregor.

364
00:15:48,164 --> 00:15:50,558
He was a knight.

365
00:15:50,601 --> 00:15:53,169
He got decapitated
in battle.

366
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:56,259
I don't think I ever really
got over Gregor.

367
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,044
Even when I met Laszlo.

368
00:15:58,087 --> 00:15:59,871
June, I've lost my boot.

369
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,613
June?

370
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:04,050
Come on, June.

371
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:05,790
The man I saw last night,

372
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,618
I think it is him.

373
00:16:07,662 --> 00:16:11,144
I think it is my reincarnated
ex-boyfriend Gregor,

374
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:12,797
with his head.

375
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:13,842
LASZLO:
Put it on, June.

376
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:16,149
-Shut up, Laszlo!
-Yes, there we are.

377
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,846
Boot on.

378
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,286
Okay, it's just
down here somewhere.

379
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,419
Why haven't I been to
this part of the house before?

380
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:27,073
It's so lovely.

381
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:28,944
-No one has for 80 years.
- Gorgeous.

382
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,293
What are we doing down here?

383
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:32,034
There is a chamber, okay?

384
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,036
It's going to be perfect
for the bloodfeast.

385
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,820
If we have the ceremony
in here,

386
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:38,258
then you-know-who
won't even need to know.

387
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,129
I mean Colin.

388
00:16:40,173 --> 00:16:43,132
-Colin, what are you doing
in here?
-Oh...

389
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:46,048
This is my bedroom.
I'm resting.

390
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,182
-You idiot.

391
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,618
I didn't know he was
gonna be in there.

392
00:16:50,661 --> 00:16:52,489
-Why didn't you check?

393
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,970
It's fine, we're gonna have
the ceremony in the attic.

394
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,754
We can't,
the StairMaster's in there.

395
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,669
Well, we're going to move
the StairMaster.

396
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,458
LASZLO:
Is it definitely this boat?

397
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,981
NANDOR:
There he is.

398
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,417
NADJA:
I knew he'd have a big box.

399
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:10,333
June, you need to go
and fetch him.

400
00:17:13,249 --> 00:17:15,121
WHARFINGER:
Sir, I just need someone
to sign for it.

401
00:17:15,164 --> 00:17:17,993
-Where's the pen?
-So, the tablet is the paper.

402
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,126
Your finger is the pen.

403
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,519
Okay, that's weird.

404
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,434
Okay, that's nothing.

405
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:26,480
Both of you, for some reason,
aren't registering here.

406
00:17:26,523 --> 00:17:27,959
You got long nails maybe
or something?

407
00:17:28,003 --> 00:17:29,091
Would you like a go, Laszlo?

408
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:31,137
-Do you have a quill?
-No, it's all digital.

409
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,877
Then I'm not signing that.

410
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,575
Guillermo, give me your hand.

411
00:17:34,618 --> 00:17:37,230
-Ah.
-Okay!

412
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,537
GUILLERMO:
I think the baron
might be here

413
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,670
to see me become a vampire.

414
00:17:42,713 --> 00:17:45,673
That would be really cool.

415
00:17:45,716 --> 00:17:49,024
I'm ready.

416
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:54,334
NADJA:
I should be preparing
for the bloodfeast,

417
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:57,685
but I can't seem to stay away
from new Gregor.

418
00:17:57,728 --> 00:18:01,210
Man. Human man. Man!

419
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:05,562
-S-Sorry, what did you say?
-Gregor,

420
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:06,781
it is you.

421
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,348
Oh, my name is Jeff.

422
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,786
-Jeff?
-J-Jeff Suckler.

423
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:14,745
My sweet Greg... Jeff S...

424
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,573
Really-- J-Jeff Suckler?

425
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:19,402
-Yeah.
-Ew.

426
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,063
I call that "Nadja's Theme."

427
00:18:35,984 --> 00:18:37,725
Guillermo, are the virgins
arriving soon?

428
00:18:37,768 --> 00:18:40,206
They should be
any minute now, Master.

429
00:18:40,249 --> 00:18:41,337
-Fingers crossed.

430
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,643
Sorry.

431
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:45,080
Don't do that.

432
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:49,084
Ah. Dinner is served.

433
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,390
Yum, yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum....

434
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,045
Hello.
So glad you could make it.

435
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:55,351
Please come in, quickly.

436
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:01,314
Everyone, this is Jenna
and Jonathan.

437
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:02,750
-Hi.
-Hi.

438
00:19:02,793 --> 00:19:03,794
Are you virgins?

439
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,056
LASZLO:
Mm.

440
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,449
I don't see how that's relevant.

441
00:19:06,493 --> 00:19:07,668
-Mm.
-I'm actually

442
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:09,409
in a relationship online,

443
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:12,020
but we've yet to meet IRL.

444
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:14,631
Well done, Guillermo.

445
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:15,850
Yeah.

446
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,243
JONATHAN:
All right, okay, let's do it.

447
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,204
Are they a vampire LARP group?

448
00:19:22,248 --> 00:19:23,771
Yeah, well, why don't we
wait in here?

449
00:19:23,814 --> 00:19:25,468
The party's gonna start
in a few minutes,

450
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:28,210
so we can just hang out,
and I'll come get you when...

451
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,996
GUILLERMO:
No. No, no, no!
No, no, no, no.

452
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,129
No, no, no.
I said no!

453
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:40,570
We take our LARPing
very seriously.

454
00:19:40,614 --> 00:19:44,357
And that was just an example.
I wanted you to see that.

455
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,489
I'm inspired.

456
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:48,622
So, are you a knight?

457
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,885
Yeah, I'm...
Well, no, uh, sorry.

458
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,930
I thought you were
gonna say "night watchman."

459
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,454
I'm a-I'm a night watchman

460
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:56,456
Mmm.

461
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:58,849
Protector of the people.

462
00:19:58,893 --> 00:20:00,460
Oh, no, not-not really.

463
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:09,164
Oh, my sweet Gregor-Jeff,

464
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,515
I forgot how much ofa fantastic raconteur you were.

465
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:13,516
-Oh, yeah.

466
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,735
Oh, yeah, yeah.

467
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,432
Ooh, do you remember
that first time

468
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,130
that we made love,
and it was so passionate

469
00:20:19,174 --> 00:20:20,871
that I accidentally
cut off your head?

470
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:22,482
-No. What?
-Mm!

471
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:25,267
But then I kept going, squeezing

472
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,487
until my needs were met. Hmm.

473
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,358
We should do that again.

474
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:32,056
But I mustn't.
But I want to.

475
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,406
But you can't.

476
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,669
But I have been married
for such a long time.

477
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,410
-Oh.

478
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,198
-I must go.
-Okay.

479
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,504
-Let me just get your number
before you go...

480
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:46,506
...so we can... I can...
we can do that again.

481
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,117
Uh...

482
00:20:52,903 --> 00:20:54,557
-You're late.
-NANDOR: Throw it.

483
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,472
That's it.

484
00:20:56,516 --> 00:20:58,735
Okay, Guillermo.

485
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:03,653
We three... not counting
Guillermo... or June...

486
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,742
or you...

487
00:21:05,786 --> 00:21:08,484
are gathered here in accordancewith the ancient...

488
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,746
Get on with it.

489
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,139
-NADJA: Get on with it.
-Guys.

490
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,359
-In bearings with the ordinance-

491
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:16,449
of the nine generations
that have surpassed us

492
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:19,321
before this historic
and memorable moment.

493
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:24,195
Guillermo, open the casket

494
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:26,589
of Baron Afanas.

495
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,592
-Oh...

496
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:31,420
Oh, it opens all by itself.

497
00:21:31,464 --> 00:21:33,466
It's so cool.

498
00:21:34,423 --> 00:21:38,166
♪ In nomine Patris♪

499
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:42,257
♪ Et Filii♪

500
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,434
♪ Et Spiritus Sancti...♪

501
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,745
LASZLO:
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...

502
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:54,530
I say, old chap,
that's our familiar.

503
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,060
Good God.

504
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:04,627
Guillermo, did you see?

505
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,281
He ate the familiar.

506
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,155
That's scary.

507
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,636
Ne la materia

508
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,378
che mai non dorme

509
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:21,252
re de le forme.

510
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:25,561
I have risen again.

511
00:22:26,823 --> 00:22:28,738
Hello, Nadja.

512
00:22:28,782 --> 00:22:30,479
Hello.

513
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,568
He's so hilarious.

514
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:34,614
-Laszlo.
-LASZLO: Yes.

515
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:37,268
I seem to remember him
having genitals.

516
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,575
NADJA:
No, never. That is why he was
such a good lover.

517
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:42,317
Guillermo, fetch the virgins.

518
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,841
As an advocate of the old ways,

519
00:22:44,885 --> 00:22:47,627
-can I just apologize
for the crepe paper?
-NANDOR: Hey...

520
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,672
It should have been
human skin, obviously.

521
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:52,588
And I deeply apologize
for the StairMaster.

522
00:22:52,632 --> 00:22:55,199
-It's all his fault.
-I go through all this effort,
I get the creepy paper.

523
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:57,288
-I get Guillermo to...
-LASZLO: It's not "creepy."

524
00:22:57,332 --> 00:22:58,812
It's crepepaper, crepe.

525
00:22:58,855 --> 00:23:02,032
Silence!

526
00:23:02,076 --> 00:23:06,515
I come with a proclamation.

527
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,823
The old ways...

528
00:23:09,866 --> 00:23:12,434
are over.

529
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:13,827
Which is what I just said.

530
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,830
The New World, as you call it,

531
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,875
is our lifeline

532
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:22,226
to an eternal future.

533
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,532
Si...

534
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:27,710
It's a documentary crew.
They're cameras.

535
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:29,146
It's like they're not even here.

536
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,800
-They are filming me?
-Yes.

537
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:32,454
NANDOR:
Just pretend
like they're not there.

538
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:34,021
It's kind of a natural piece.

539
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:35,718
You were saying, Baron?

540
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:38,112
Centuries have passed,

541
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:42,508
and you have not conquered
the New World.

542
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,467
You hide in the shadows.

543
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,513
Bah. You are weak.

544
00:23:47,556 --> 00:23:48,688
JONATHAN:
Oh, God. Oh...

545
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,472
NANDOR:
Not now, Guillermo.

546
00:23:50,516 --> 00:23:52,474
GUILLERMO:
Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

547
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:54,171
-Go.
-BARON: Oh, by now,

548
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:57,523
you should rule this,
this, uh...

549
00:23:57,566 --> 00:24:00,700
-what is this place again?
-Staten Island.

550
00:24:00,743 --> 00:24:02,745
This Staten Island.

551
00:24:05,008 --> 00:24:07,663
Is this Staten Island
the seat of power

552
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,622
in the New World?

553
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:12,276
It is where the boat
dropped us off.

554
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,628
Down with the old ways.
Up with t-the New World.

555
00:24:15,671 --> 00:24:18,500
I've been saying it for
centuries, and he would never

556
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:20,763
-listen...
-Shh.

557
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:24,680
Mm. I must slumber.

558
00:24:24,724 --> 00:24:26,682
But when I awaken,

559
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:29,729
we will rule this...

560
00:24:29,772 --> 00:24:31,774
Staten Island.

561
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:34,211
Y-Yes.

562
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:35,648
-Yes!
-Yes.

563
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:36,866
Nadja?

564
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,913
Baron.

565
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:43,743
-Laszlo.
-Baron.

566
00:24:43,786 --> 00:24:44,831
It's Nandor.

567
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,186
LASZLO:
Thank God.

568
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:53,579
NANDOR:
The Baron is furious with us.

569
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:56,538
It's so dumb
that I wore glitter.

570
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:57,757
Let's get rid of this shit.

571
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,323
If we don't conquer
the New World,

572
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:00,673
he's going to kill us.

573
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,588
Again.

574
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:05,416
-Basically, we're fucked.
-Fucked.

575
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:09,769
NANDOR:
Well, that was
a complete disaster.

576
00:25:09,812 --> 00:25:11,814
At least we have the virgins.

577
00:25:13,294 --> 00:25:15,818
-Uh, yes.

578
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,389
...for an economy car.

579
00:25:21,432 --> 00:25:23,609
-NANDOR: Oh, great.
-GUILLERMO: We're too late.

580
00:25:23,652 --> 00:25:26,568
Colin Robinson has drained themof all their energy.

581
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,962
COLIN:
"How are you gonna
wash this car?"

582
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:31,268
NANDOR:
They have
no nutritional value now.

583
00:25:31,312 --> 00:25:32,705
COLIN:
And I know you two said
you don't drive,

584
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:34,620
and don't have
driver's licenses,

585
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,709
but are you gonna do a...

586
00:25:36,752 --> 00:25:38,058
a-a different type
of car wash,

587
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:40,626
maybe having detailing done?

588
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:43,193
Now, detailing,
they go into your car

589
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:45,718
and they get into the nooks
and crannies, so...

590
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,285
Anyway, you take care, okay?

591
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,729
You are glum, Guillermo.

592
00:25:56,772 --> 00:25:58,382
-: No.
-Yes.

593
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:00,384
You think that I've forgotten
that tonight

594
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:03,213
is a special occasion for you
as well, haven't you?

595
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:11,526
Does not an anniversary
deserve a reward

596
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,703
recognizing your years
of service?

597
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,880
I'm ready, Master.

598
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,490
Good.

599
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:22,058
Prepare yourself.

600
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,675
Happy anniversary, Guillermo.

601
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,639
-Wow...
-It's a glitter portrait.

602
00:26:37,683 --> 00:26:41,904
It's a portrait
made from glitter.

603
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,689
Look, it's you.

604
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:46,082
I made you a vampire.

605
00:26:46,126 --> 00:26:47,693
And look who's next to you.

606
00:26:47,736 --> 00:26:49,085
It's me.

607
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:51,784
-Wow.
-Enjoy it.

608
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:54,917
You can put it
in your depressing room.

609
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:59,139
And you deserve it.
Two years of service.

610
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:00,836
T-Ten.

611
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,708
Ten years of service.

612
00:27:02,751 --> 00:27:05,885
-Ten.
-Ten years of service?

613
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,803
Okay.

614
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:35,871
NANDOR:
