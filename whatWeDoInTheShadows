;♪ You're dead and out of this world.♪
;It's nightfall.
;The job of a vampire's familiar
;is not an easy one.
;It's very dangerous.
;I mean, they are vampires, after all.
;We can go in now.
;Good evening, Master.
;MAN : Guillermo?
;Yes, sir?
;-Is that you? -Yes, Master.
;-Okay. -Okay, Master.
;It's time to... rise.
;MAN: The... Okay.
;MAN: Guillermo, it is stuck.
;I think it is the latch.
;GUILLERMO: Being a vampire's familiar
;is like being a best friend.
;Who-Who's also a slave.
;-MAN: Guillermo, it's too loud.-What?
;GUILLERMO: Tomorrow night marks
;the ten-year anniversary since
;I started working for my Master.
;I think he's planning something pretty special.
;: I think he's gonna make me a vampire.
;MAN: This is very embarrassing.
;Okay, Master.
;He awakens.
;Very cool, Master.
;Very scary.
;Thank you.
;♪ Don't sing if you want to live long♪
;♪ They have no use for your song♪
;♪ You're dead, you're dead, you're dead♪
;♪ You're dead and out of this world♪
;♪ Now your hope and compassion is gone♪
;♪ You sold out your dream to the world♪
;♪ Stay dead, stay dead, stay dead♪
;♪ You're dead and out of this world.♪
;NANDOR: Everyone?
;Nadja, Laszlo.
;-Yeah? -Yes? -Can you come downstairs
;for a second, please?
;Thank you, Laszlo.
;In your own time, Nadja.
;Yes, good, excellent.
;So, listen.
;We have received a letter
;and I would like very much to read it to you.
;-But not here, we want to go into the library. -Why not here?
;I'd like to read it in there. It's just a formality.
;It'll sound exactly the same if you
;read it here than if you read it in there.
;I'm not going to disagree with you, but that's not the point.
;NANDOR:  I was a very ferocious soldier
;in the Ottoman Empire.
;Which meant a lot of killing, lot of pillaging.
;People would say, "Please, don't pillage me."
;And I would say, "No.
;I'm pillaging everyone, you included."
;I was relentless.
;They would call me Nandor
;the Relentless.
;Because I just never relent.
;So I'd like very much for us to go into there, please.
;Just a formality.
;Come on, please, it's just a formality.
;-You could have read it by now.-Hmm.
;Just a formality, okay? Look, it's not even that far.
;-Oh, fuck this, fine. -Thank you, Laszlo.
;It's just a formality, please, Nadja.
;-Just a formality, thank you.
;Guillermo, the door.
;-That wasn't so bad, was it?
;Now before we go into the reading of the letter,
;I wanted to talk about general hygiene in the cell.
;-Last night,
;there were all these people down there,
;shouting and screaming, half-drunk.
;Where did they find the alcohol?
;No, they were half-drunk. They'd been half drunk.
;-Oh. -Please, finish a whole victim
;before moving on to a next one, okay?
;It's very unhygienic.
;I think I know who's leaving them down there,
;-but I don't want to say.-If you've got something to say,
;-then damn well say it. -It's not hygienic.
;How dare you.
;The problems with living with other vampires
;are the vampires I have chosen to stay with.
;Nandor is like
;a big turkey just walking around
;trying to control everything on the farm.
;-Hyah!
;NADJA: And Laszlo is my big, crazy,
;wild bear and we love to chase each other around the house.
;-I ought to fucking kill you!
;We have a great time together.
;LASZLO: I was the most handsome man
;in our village.
;His village was very badly affected
;by leprosy and the plague.
;That's true.
;And I, myself, did contract leprosy,
;but I was quite lucky 'cause it couldn't be seen.
;It was only one part of my anatomy.
;Well, I can see it.
;Anyway, one night,
;I was awoken by this...
;horrible clawing at the window.
;And I thought, "Who the hell is that?
;'Cause I live on the third floor."
;So I went to investigate it, I threw back the curtain...
;Well, I saw the most beautiful woman I had ever seen.
;But she was gripping the window
;and she was clawing at the glass.
;I was hypnotized.
;I used hypnosis on him.
;Which I found out later.
;Anyway, obviously I invited her in.
;We were about to make love
;when she turned into this hideous, leathery bat thing.
;She drained me of my blood,
;giving me the curse of eternal life
;and thus making me a bloodthirsty
;creature of the night.
;Why don't we just write on them with marker pen?
;Put our names and the date?
;LASZLO: Oh, that's a good suggestion.
;-NADJA: Yeah. -Good idea, Nadja.
;Marker pens, Guillermo.
;Make sure they're permanent.
;-Sharpie. -LASZLO: Genius.
;-NADJA: With date, as well. -Yes, great thinking, Nadja.
;-And yes, this... yes. -The name of the month, day, year.
;Okay.
;And now we come...
;to the reading... of the letter.
;-At last.
;Guillermo? Close the door.
;-The door's closed, Master. -Close it more.
;More.
;Good.
;-Now that we are gathered here...
;together as one, finally,
;in accordance with the protocols...
;Which you made up.
;Yes.
;We have received this letter.
;From Baron... Afanas.
;Really?
;Yes.
;NANDOR: How do you...
;-GUILLERMO: Like that. -Shh.
;The Baron...
;...is coming to visit us.
;Holy shit.
;Silence, Guillermo.
;Vampire comments only.
;The Baron never leaves the old country.
;Has he told us what the purposeof his visit is?
;Uh...
;No.
;LASZLO: The Baron is a firm believer
;that vampires should rule the world.
;I think the main purpose for the Baron's visit
;is to find out whether we as vampires
;have populated America.
;But as you can see,
;the place is fucking massive.
;When is he coming, exactly?
;-Tomorrow. -Shit.
;NANDOR: Why didn't you give this to me earlier?
;It arrived this morning, Master.
;NADJA: Baron Afanas is...
;a very charming member of the vampire royalty.
;A few hundred years ago,
;we enjoyed a very intense, very long sexual affair.
;It was pretty wild.
;Lots of acrobatic stuff.
;This could make it awkward,
;to see him with Laszlo...
;present.
;LASZLO: Just between you and I,
;a while back, the Baron and I
;enjoyed a very intense sex affair.
;Very animalistic.
;Acrobatic stuff, you might say.
;So I, personally,
;am very much looking forward to reconnecting.
;We should get a chariot led by
;12 black alligators.
;-I like that. -That's a lot of alligators,
;a lot of paint.
;What about a van?
;A van?
;That's not the same, is it?
;Can you at least make sure it's black?
;Yeah. Black van for tomorrow?
;Excellent. Uh, what about the Baron's bloodlust?
;-Virgins. -Oh, yes, let's do that.
;Guillermo, two virgins by tomorrow evening.
;-Yes, when the Baron arrives
;we shall feast on virgin blood.
;Vampire only laughing.
;-Should we tell Colin Robinson?-Laszlo,
;-that is a terrible idea.
;He'll ruin the evening.
;Uh, what would ruin the evening?
;I told you-- didn't close the door properly.
;Are we having a house meeting?
;-No. -No.
;So, your gathering here...
;is just a coincidence?
;Yes.
;COLIN: My name is Colin Robinson.
;And I am what's known as
;a psychic vampire.
;Or energy vampire.
;This is my office.
;Also known as the hunting ground.
;Hi, Deb.
;Energy vampires drain people's energy
;merely by talking to them.
;Actual v. Budget, year-to-date, no thanks.
;You're gonna be at that all day.
;We either bore you
;with a long conversation...
;Feeling better now, I was a little sick this weekend.
;Hey, Don.
;Don?
;I have to pee, too.
;Or...
;Hey.
;...we enrage you.
;In fact, you probably know an energy vampire.
;We're the most common kind...
;of vampire.
;We are day-walkers, not affected by the sun.
;And we are the only kind of vampire
;that can drain another vampire's energy.
;It's very cool.
;The power grows stronger in him by the night.
;GUILLERMO: There's different kinds of jobs that I have to do.
;Keep the house tidy.
;Make sure there's no sunlight.
;Sunlight! Why, Guillermo,
;why?!
;Not on my watch.
;Getting rid of carcasses,
;I feel, is a big one.
;So, we are under the stairs and this is my bedroom.
;This is a picture of me as Armand
;from Interview with the Vampire.
;Played by Antonio Banderas.
;That was the first time I've ever seen
;an Hispanic vampire
;in mainstream, like, movies.
;And I said, "If he can do it, I-I...
;I can do it."
;Guillermo... boarded this whole window up,
;it's a huge sunlight risk.
;We wouldn't want the Baron waking up to sunlight
;and being turned into barbecue meat.
;Yeah, really cover it.
;He's made a lot of comments recently, like,
;"I'm going to make you a vampire."
;This is a little coffin toy that, uh...
;I hope to be in one of these one day.
;What ho, good friends.
;LARPERS: What ho!
;There's still a few places to find virgins.
;LARPing stands for Live Action Role Playing.
;In regular life, I'm just Jonathan.
;But here, I am a very high-level paladin.
;GUILLERMO: I'm not a killer.
;I find people who are easy...
;to... kill.
;Is that a 14th-century battle-ax?
;Oh, it's so exciting.
;Uh, will we be able to touch the swords?
;Oh, you'll touch the swords.
;NADJA: We moved here from Europe
;about 200 years ago because there was
;a lot of prejudice  against vampires at that time.
;They don't like the color of our skin.
;Or the fact that we killed and ate people.
;Probably more that.
;LASZLO: We're being very careful not to stand out,
;which is why we're both dressed down.
;-Uh, good evening. -Go back to your own country.
;What the fuck did you just say?
;You heard me, Ghost of Christmas Past bitch.
;Oh, Mike, shut up.
;Silence to you. We've been here since 1861.
;At least, our families have.
;Begone.
;We should just suck their blood,I'm absolutely starving.
;-They're perfect. -No, I'm furious.
;He just insulted me, I'm in fifth gear.
;-We should kill them. -Yes, that's what I'm saying.
;-We should suck their blood. -Yes.
;-LASZLO: Now? -NADJA: Wait. Wait, darling.
;-Now? -Now!
;What?
;-Mike?
;Where the fuck are you?
;What the fuck?
;Yum, yum, yum. He was delicious.
;Now, listen, I don't know about you,
;but I'm very much in the mood for some sexual intercourse.
;Darling. Right next to the public toilet?
;Yes. But why don't I get home,
;get cleaned up, then we can carry on with our love-making.
;Um, I'm going to walk home.
;--Why the hell would you do that?
;Why would you walk home?
;When you could turn into a bat?
;Bat!
;NANDOR:  I would like some of that, uh,
;colorful dust that sparkles.
;-Glitter? -Yes.
;Get me some glitter.
;Whatever for, Master?
;Oh, I want to do something special
;for the Immortal One's arrival.
;I'm going to sprinkle it on my face and on my body.
;Like Twilight.
;So deliciously macabre.
;-Creepy paper. -It's crepe paper.
;-Creepy paper. -It's crepe paper, Master.
;Creepy... Oh, multipack.
;Master, this is pretty "macarbre."
;NANDOR: Guillermo is my familiar,
;but sometimes he's a little toofamiliar, you know what I mean?
;I mean, he's always just there.
;I think it's good, Master.
;NANDOR: I mean, he works really hard,
;he's just not great at it.
;Guillermo, my cape is stuck.
;I don't like saying this kind of thing
;in front of him, of course.
;Sorry, Guillermo.
;I don't like saying this kind of thing in front of you.
;That's okay, Master.
;Lot of glitter.
;-Cash or card? -Credit.
;You cannot pay with that.
;GUILLERMO: I'm so sorry.
;-Did you just throw a coin at me? -Yes.
;Sir, you can't be throwing ancient coins at me.
;-Just... Credit card's fine. -Guillermo, stab this man.
;-He's joking. -Stab him.
;-Ahh... -Thank you.
;-I tried, and... -Here you go, man.
;-Thank you so much. -You kind of disobeyed me just now.
;And I'm noting it.
;NADJA: Recently I have been seeing another man.
;He doesn't see me, though, because I sneak behind him.
;I watch him in the night,
;in secret.
;In the old country, centuries ago,
;I was in a very passionate love affair
;with a human man called Gregor.
;He was a knight.
;He got decapitated in battle.
;I don't think I ever really got over Gregor.
;Even when I met Laszlo.
;June, I've lost my boot.
;June?
;Come on, June.
;The man I saw last night,
;I think it is him.
;I think it is my reincarnated ex-boyfriend Gregor,
;with his head.
;LASZLO: Put it on, June.
;-Shut up, Laszlo! -Yes, there we are.
;Boot on.
;Okay, it's just down here somewhere.
;Why haven't I been to this part of the house before?
;It's so lovely.
;-No one has for 80 years. - Gorgeous.
;What are we doing down here?
;There is a chamber, okay?
;It's going to be perfect for the bloodfeast.
;If we have the ceremony in here,
;then you-know-who won't even need to know.
;I mean Colin.
;-Colin, what are you doing in here? -Oh...
;This is my bedroom. I'm resting.
;-You idiot.
;I didn't know he was gonna be in there.
;-Why didn't you check?
;It's fine, we're gonna have the ceremony in the attic.
;We can't, the StairMaster's in there.
;Well, we're going to move the StairMaster.
;LASZLO: Is it definitely this boat?
;NANDOR: There he is.
;NADJA: I knew he'd have a big box.
;June, you need to go and fetch him.
;WHARFINGER: Sir, I just need someone to sign for it.
;-Where's the pen? -So, the tablet is the paper.
;Your finger is the pen.
;Okay, that's weird.
;Okay, that's nothing.
;Both of you, for some reason, aren't registering here.
;You got long nails maybe or something?
;Would you like a go, Laszlo?
;-Do you have a quill? -No, it's all digital.
;Then I'm not signing that.
;Guillermo, give me your hand.
;-Ah. -Okay!
;GUILLERMO: I think the baron might be here
;to see me become a vampire.
;That would be really cool.
;I'm ready.
;NADJA: I should be preparing for the bloodfeast,
;but I can't seem to stay away from new Gregor.
;Man. Human man. Man!
;-S-Sorry, what did you say? -Gregor,
;it is you.
;Oh, my name is Jeff.
;-Jeff? -J-Jeff Suckler.
;My sweet Greg... Jeff S...
;Really-- J-Jeff Suckler?
;-Yeah. -Ew.
;I call that "Nadja's Theme."
;Guillermo, are the virgins arriving soon?
;They should be any minute now, Master.
;-Fingers crossed.
;Sorry.
;Don't do that.
;Ah. Dinner is served.
;Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum....
;Hello. So glad you could make it.
;Please come in, quickly.
;Everyone, this is Jenna and Jonathan.
;-Hi. -Hi.
;Are you virgins?
;LASZLO: Mm.
;I don't see how that's relevant.
;-Mm. -I'm actually
;in a relationship online,
;but we've yet to meet IRL.
;Well done, Guillermo.
;Yeah.
;JONATHAN: All right, okay, let's do it.
;Are they a vampire LARP group?
;Yeah, well, why don't we wait in here?
;The party's gonna start in a few minutes,
;so we can just hang out, and I'll come get you when...
;GUILLERMO: No. No, no, no! No, no, no, no.
;No, no, no. I said no!
;We take our LARPing very seriously.
;And that was just an example. I wanted you to see that.
;I'm inspired.
;So, are you a knight?
;Yeah, I'm... Well, no, uh, sorry.
;I thought you were gonna say "night watchman."
;I'm a-I'm a night watchman
;Mmm.
;Protector of the people.
;Oh, no, not-not really.
;Oh, my sweet Gregor-Jeff,
;I forgot how much ofa fantastic raconteur you were.
;-Oh, yeah.
;Oh, yeah, yeah.
;Ooh, do you remember that first time
;that we made love, and it was so passionate
;that I accidentally cut off your head?
;-No. What? -Mm!
;But then I kept going, squeezing
;until my needs were met. Hmm.
;We should do that again.
;But I mustn't. But I want to.
;But you can't.
;But I have been married for such a long time.
;-Oh.
;-I must go. -Okay.
;-Let me just get your number before you go...
;...so we can... I can... we can do that again.
;Uh...
;-You're late. -NANDOR: Throw it.
;That's it.
;Okay, Guillermo.
;We three... not counting Guillermo... or June...
;or you...
;are gathered here in accordancewith the ancient...
;Get on with it.
;-NADJA: Get on with it. -Guys.
;-In bearings with the ordinance-
;of the nine generations that have surpassed us
;before this historic and memorable moment.
;Guillermo, open the casket
;of Baron Afanas.
;-Oh...
;Oh, it opens all by itself.
;It's so cool.
;♪ In nomine Patris♪
;♪ Et Filii♪
;♪ Et Spiritus Sancti...♪
;LASZLO: Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa...
;I say, old chap, that's our familiar.
;Good God.
;Guillermo, did you see?
;He ate the familiar.
;That's scary.
;Ne la materia
;che mai non dorme
;re de le forme.
;I have risen again.
;Hello, Nadja.
;Hello.
;He's so hilarious.
;-Laszlo. -LASZLO: Yes.
;I seem to remember him having genitals.
;NADJA: No, never. That is why he was such a good lover.
;Guillermo, fetch the virgins.
;As an advocate of the old ways,
;-can I just apologize for the crepe paper? -NANDOR: Hey...
;It should have been human skin, obviously.
;And I deeply apologize for the StairMaster.
;-It's all his fault. -I go through all this effort, I get the creepy paper.
;-I get Guillermo to... -LASZLO: It's not "creepy."
;It's crepepaper, crepe.
;Silence!
;I come with a proclamation.
;The old ways...
;are over.
;Which is what I just said.
;The New World, as you call it,
;is our lifeline
;to an eternal future.
;Si...
;It's a documentary crew. They're cameras.
;It's like they're not even here.
;-They are filming me? -Yes.
;NANDOR: Just pretend like they're not there.
;It's kind of a natural piece.
;You were saying, Baron?
;Centuries have passed,
;and you have not conquered the New World.
;You hide in the shadows.
;Bah. You are weak.
;JONATHAN: Oh, God. Oh...
;NANDOR: Not now, Guillermo.
;GUILLERMO: Go, go, go. Go, go, go.
;-Go. -BARON: Oh, by now,
;you should rule this, this, uh...
;-what is this place again? -Staten Island.
;This Staten Island.
;Is this Staten Island the seat of power
;in the New World?
;It is where the boat dropped us off.
;Down with the old ways. Up with t-the New World.
;I've been saying it for centuries, and he would never
;-listen... -Shh.
;Mm. I must slumber.
;But when I awaken,
;we will rule this...
;Staten Island.
;Y-Yes.
;-Yes! -Yes.
;Nadja?
;Baron.
;-Laszlo. -Baron.
;It's Nandor.
;LASZLO: Thank God.
;NANDOR: The Baron is furious with us.
;It's so dumb that I wore glitter.
;Let's get rid of this shit.
;If we don't conquer the New World,
;he's going to kill us.
;Again.
;-Basically, we're fucked. -Fucked.
;NANDOR: Well, that was a complete disaster.
;At least we have the virgins.
;-Uh, yes.
;...for an economy car.
;-NANDOR: Oh, great. -GUILLERMO: We're too late.
;Colin Robinson has drained themof all their energy.
;COLIN: "How are you gonna wash this car?"
;NANDOR: They have no nutritional value now.
;COLIN: And I know you two said you don't drive,
;and don't have driver's licenses,
;but are you gonna do a...
;a-a different type of car wash,
;maybe having detailing done?
;Now, detailing, they go into your car
;and they get into the nooks and crannies, so...
;Anyway, you take care, okay?
;You are glum, Guillermo.
;-: No. -Yes.
;You think that I've forgotten that tonight
;is a special occasion for you as well, haven't you?
;Does not an anniversary deserve a reward
;recognizing your years of service?
;I'm ready, Master.
;Good.
;Prepare yourself.
;Happy anniversary, Guillermo.
;-Wow... -It's a glitter portrait.
;It's a portrait made from glitter.
;Look, it's you.
;I made you a vampire.
;And look who's next to you.
;It's me.
;-Wow. -Enjoy it.
;You can put it in your depressing room.
;And you deserve it. Two years of service.
;T-Ten.
;Ten years of service.
;-Ten. -Ten years of service?
;Okay.
;NANDOR: Night, Guillermo.
;♪ Tonight in the moonlight♪
;♪ When I'm alone with you♪
;♪ Tonight in the moonlight♪
;♪ With you.♪
;♪ Don't sing if you want to live long♪
;♪ They have no use for your song♪
;♪ You're dead, you're dead, you're dead♪
